excerpt: 'Liquid biopsies may be confounded by alterations arising from clonal hematopoeisis.  This study uses targeted sequencing of matched cfDNA and white blood cells to distinguish cfDNA from other cfDNA alterations and highlights the utility of ctDNA as a predictive biomarker of patient outcome to perioperative cancer therapy and surgical resection in patients with gastric cancer.'

Liquid biopsies may be confounded by alterations arising from clonal hematopoeisis.  This study uses targeted sequencing of matched cfDNA and white blood cells to distinguish cfDNA from other cfDNA alterations and highlights the utility of ctDNA as a predictive biomarker of patient outcome to perioperative cancer therapy and surgical resection in patients with gastric cancer.
