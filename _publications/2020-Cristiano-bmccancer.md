Using genomic data from multiple study cites, this paper demonstrates that lab effects are not necessarily the principal source of batch effects in large scale studies.  We develop a Bayesian hierarchical model for DNA copy number, controlling for batch effects by grouping chemistry plates in a manner that is dependent on the genomic region.  Probalistic estimates of copy number are incorporated in a Bayesian logistic regression model for pancreatic cancer risk.
