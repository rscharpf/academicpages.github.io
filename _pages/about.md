# Scientific Interests

- Statistical methods and machine learning approaches for detection of tumor-derived DNA based on genome-wide cell-free DNA fragmentation patterns.  Applications include the early detection of cancer and monitoring disease in late stage cancer patients.

- Methods and software for modeling technical and biological variation within and between large-scale studies with high-throughput data.  Applications include Bayesian hierarchical models for differential gene expression analysis in multiple studies and Bayesian hierarchical models for copy number estimation.

- Modeling the contribution of molecular characteristics to cancer risk using models that incorporate measurement error of genomic variants.

- Bayesian approaches to model uncertainty in evolutionary models of cancer progression.

- SNPchip: A few plotting utilities for log R ratios / BAFs; chromosome idiograms

- VanillaICE: A hidden Markov model for inferring copy number alterations from genotyping arrays

- XDE: A Bayesian hierarchical model for cross-study differential gene expression

- MinimumDistance: Methods for calling de novo copy number variants in case-parent trios

- CNPBayes: a Bayesian hierarchical model for copy number estimation and integration with cancer risk models
